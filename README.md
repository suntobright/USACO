# Description

This repository is used to record the solutions of USACO problems.

USACO is short for USA Computing Olympiad.
There is a website used to teach you coding skills step by step, which is http://train.usaco.org/usacogate.
And the code here is the solutions of these training problems.

# Organization

The Organization here is very straight-forward. These folders are corresponding to the sections of training program.

# Content

All code under master branch has passed the tests from the website.

These code here is not whole completed, since my training is still in progress. I will update if I get some time.

I'm sorry for the missing comments. I hope the code will help your training.
